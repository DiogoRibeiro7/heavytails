HeavyTails is a comprehensive Python library for working with heavy-tailed probability distributions. NumPy is its only dependency. Every method takes a number or an array and gives back the same kind of thing, and the formula in between is written once, which keeps the implementations transparent and mathematically rigorous while making them fast enough for academic research, quantitative finance, risk management, and education.

## 🎯 Quick Start

```python
from heavytails import Pareto, StudentT, LogNormal
from heavytails.tail_index import hill_estimator

# Create a Pareto distribution
dist = Pareto(alpha=2.0, xm=1.0)

# Generate samples
samples = dist.rvs(1000, seed=42)

# Estimate tail index
gamma_hat = hill_estimator(samples, k=100)
alpha_hat = 1.0 / gamma_hat
print(f"Estimated tail index: {alpha_hat:.2f}")
```

## 📚 What's Inside

### Core Features

- **12+ Heavy-Tailed Distributions**: Pareto, Student-t, Cauchy, LogNormal, Weibull, Fréchet, GEV, GPD, Burr XII, and more
- **Tail Index Estimation**: Hill, Pickands, and moment estimators
- **Scalar or Array**: Every method mirrors its input, over NumPy, with one implementation per formula
- **Command-Line Interface**: Full CLI for analysis and visualization
- **Financial Applications**: Risk management tools for VaR, ES, and tail risk

### Mathematical Excellence

- **Numerical Stability**: Carefully implemented special functions
- **Academic Rigor**: Proper mathematical foundations and references
- **Validation**: Cross-validated against R and SciPy implementations
- **Performance**: Optimized algorithms with benchmarking

## 🧮 Mathematical Background

Heavy-tailed distributions are characterized by:

$$P(X > x) \sim x^{-\alpha} L(x) \text{ as } x \to \infty$$

where $L(x)$ is a slowly varying function and $\alpha > 0$ is the tail index.

**Applications include:**

- **Finance**: Stock returns, portfolio risk, extreme losses
- **Insurance**: Catastrophic claims, reinsurance modeling
- **Network Analysis**: Internet traffic, social networks
- **Environmental Science**: Extreme weather, natural disasters

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
# From PyPI (recommended)
pip install heavytails

# Development installation
git clone https://github.com/diogoribeiro7/heavytails.git
cd heavytails
poetry install
```

## 🔍 Examples by Domain

### Finance & Risk Management

```python
from heavytails import GeneralizedPareto, BurrXII
from heavytails.finance_applications import RiskMetrics

# Value-at-Risk estimation with GPD
risk = RiskMetrics(portfolio_returns)
var_95 = risk.var_gpd(alpha=0.05, threshold=0.1)
```

### Extreme Value Analysis

```python
from heavytails import GEV_Frechet, Frechet
from heavytails.tail_index import pickands_estimator

# Block maxima analysis
gev = GEV_Frechet(xi=0.2, mu=10, sigma=2)
annual_maxima = gev.rvs(50, seed=42)
```

### Academic Research

```python
from heavytails import Cauchy, LogNormal
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Compare tail behavior
cauchy = Cauchy(x0=0, gamma=1)
lognorm = LogNormal(mu=0, sigma=1)

x = np.logspace(0, 3, 1000)
plt.loglog(x, cauchy.sf(x), label='Cauchy')
plt.loglog(x, lognorm.sf(x), label='LogNormal')
plt.legend()
plt.title('Tail Comparison')
```

## 🌟 Key Features

### ✅ **Scalar or Array**

Every method takes a number or an array and returns the same kind of thing. NumPy is the only dependency, and each formula is written once rather than twice, so the array path and the scalar path cannot disagree.

### ✅ **Mathematically Rigorous**

Proper implementation of special functions, numerical stability, academic references.

### ✅ **Production Ready**

Comprehensive testing, CI/CD pipeline, performance benchmarks.

### ✅ **Educational Focus**

Clear documentation, mathematical background, step-by-step examples.

### ✅ **Research Grade**

Validation against reference implementations, proper citations, reproducible results.
